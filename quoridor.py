The object of the game is for one player to get to
the row or column furthest to their starting position.
In each turn, the player can either move to a cell
adjacent to his current position by typing the address
like A 1, or place a 2-cell-wide wall between the cells
by typing the address of the cell to the wall's
northeast and whether it is to be horizontal or vertical,
like A 1 V. You cannot cross walls, you can jump other
players, and if your path is blocked twice, you can move
to the side of the adjacent player. The game can be
played by two or four players.
Enjoy!
